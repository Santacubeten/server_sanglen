## Project Structure (Easy English)

Imagine this project is like a small restaurant:

*   **`server.dart` (The Manager):** This is the main program. It starts the restaurant, connects to the kitchen (database), and waits for customers (your requests) to come in.

*   **`todo_routes.dart` (The Menu):** This file lists all the things you can do with "todo" items, like:
    *   "Order a new todo" (create)
    *   "See all todos" (read)
    *   "Change an existing todo" (update)
    *   "Throw away a todo" (delete)

*   **`todo.dart` (The Recipe Card):** This is just the basic idea of what a "todo" looks like â€“ it has a title, a description, and whether it's done or not.

*   **`database/` folder (The Kitchen & Storage):**
    *   `db_connection.dart` (The Kitchen Door): This handles getting into the database (our storage room).
    *   `todo_table.dart` (The Chef): This is the part that actually talks to the database to save, get, or change your "todo" items.

*   **`middleware/middleware.dart` (The Bouncer):** This checks every customer (request) before they get to the menu, making sure everything is allowed and safe.

*   **`config/swagger.yaml` and `index.html` (The Instruction Manual):**
    *   `swagger.yaml` is like a detailed book explaining every dish on the menu and how to order it.
    *   `index.html` is the webpage that shows you this book in a nice, easy-to-read way.

*   **`pubspec.yaml` (The Shopping List):** This file lists all the special ingredients (other software parts) the restaurant needs to run.

*   **`README.md` (The Welcome Sign):** This is the first thing you see, telling you what the restaurant is about and how to use its services.

So, in short, it's a small server that helps you manage your "todo" lists, stores them in a database, and even provides a nice instruction manual (Swagger) for how to use it!
